(use-modules (guix ui))

;; This file can be used to create an interactive development environment for
;; working on LibRISCV. It re-uses the package definitions from guix.scm but
;; adds additional dependencies to the manifest that are useful for development
;; purposes.
;;
;; Unfournutately, Guix does currently not provide a RV32 cross compiler, hence
;; this is not yet included in the image but may change in the future [1]. For
;; now, a clang toolchain with RISC-V support is included though.
